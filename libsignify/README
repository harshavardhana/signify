This is a self-contained port of OpenBSD's signify to Linux and other
Unixes.

Like on OpenBSD, this version of signify uses the Ed25519 primitive for
signing/verification, ChaCha for random number generation, and a
bcrypt-based KDF to protect secret keys.

Signatures and keys are 100% compatible with OpenBSD.

passphrase-20140902.diff adds the ability to add, change, or remove
secret key passphrases. This function is not currently available on
OpenBSD but in no way undermines compatibility of keys and signatures.

HOWTO and the manpage contain sample usage.

Based on http://sourceforge.net/projects/slackdepot/files/signify/,
this fork builds libsignify in static and shared mode.

This also exposes signify as a library for other people to use and
embed it in their codebase.
